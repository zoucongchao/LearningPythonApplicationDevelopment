This directory contains the following two top level directories: 

1. wargame:
-- This directory holds the code for attack of the orcs in sub-directory wargame.
-- Code in the directory is compatible with Python 3.5.x and beyond


2. src_ch4_python2
-- Python 2.7.9 equivalent of the application code

How to run the game:
$ cd wargame
$ python attackoftheorcs.py

* RUNNING THE PROGRAMS
----------------------
- General instruction:
  /path/to/python  filename.py

  Replace /path/to/python with the actual Python path on your system.
  Replace filename.py with the actual file name

RUNNING THE PROGRAMS (Python 3.5.x specific instructions)
--------------------
- Python 3.5.x must be installed on your system.
- It is assumed that you have Python 3.5 available in your environment
  variable PATH. It will be typically available as 'python' or 'python3'.
- Here is the command to execute this code from command prompt

                 $python filename.py     ( OR $python3 filename.py)

- Alternatively specify the full path to the Python 3 executable.
  For example on Linux, it could be:

                 /usr/bin/python filename.py

- On Windows OS, while installing Python 3.5, you should add Python
 to the environment variable PATH. For example, on Window 7, it could be
 installed here:
    C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\python.exe

    Where USER_NAME is your Windows user name.

    Assuming it is in the PATH, it could be run from the command prompt as:
        > python.exe filename.py
    Or simply:
        > python filename.py

 - If the above instructions doesn't help, visit python.org for OS
  specific instructions.
